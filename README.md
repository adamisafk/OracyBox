## Part of the Oracybox service
### Check out the [oracybox-web repository](https://github.com/adamisafk/oracybox-web) to setup the web service, which includes an admin panel to manage classrooms, pupils, and activities as well as the MySQL database and RESTful API.


## What is Oracybox?
Oracybox is a web service aimed at providing useful tools for teachers to monitor and assess their pupil's oracy development in the classroom.
As a teacher, you interact with the web application where you can manage pupil accounts, classrooms, and review their progress done on the iPad.
As a pupil, you will be working in pairs to complete activities on the iPad which are designed to get you communicating while learning

## Is this backed by research?
Yes! This service uses [Neil Mercer's oracy assessment toolkit](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/oracytoolkit/) which makes use of the [Oracy Skills Framework](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/oracytoolkit/oracyskillsframework/).
Some key authors used in research:

- Robin Alexander
- Andrew Wilkinson
- Maxwell and the EEF
- Millard and Menzies at Voice21

## Still in development
You should expect the first completed prototype before April!
